# Hi there, I'm Joseph! 👋

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a second-year Computer Science student at the National University of Singapore (NUS), passionate about building innovative software solutions and challenging myself to solve complex problems.

When I'm not coding, you'll often find me chilling at local cafes, constantly learning new skill sets and taking on challenges that push my boundaries. I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers and explore collaborative opportunities in software engineering.

**Fun fact:** I have a twin brother! 👯‍♂️
